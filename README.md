# RAG Knowledge Assistant with Intelligent Agents

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that connects a **Large Language Model (LLM)** with a **vector database** to enable intelligent document search and analysis.  
It is designed as a showcase project for AI Developer roles, demonstrating practical skills in **LLM integration, database engineering, and AI agents**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **RAG-powered document search**  
  Upload company documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and query them in natural language.  
  The system retrieves the most relevant text chunks from the database and augments the LLM with context-aware answers.

- **Document Ingestion Pipeline**  
  - Automatic text extraction (PDF, Word, plain text).  
  - Chunking into manageable segments.  
  - Embedding generation using an embedding model.  
  - Storage of both raw text and vector embeddings in PostgreSQL with `pgvector`.  

- **Interactive API & UI**  
  - Backend powered by Flask.  
  - React-based UI for querying and displaying results.  
  - REST endpoints for `/ask`, `/upload`, `/analyze`.

## 🧠 Agents (extended development)

In addition to core RAG functionality, the project introduces **AI agents** to handle more complex, real-world scenarios.

### 1. Document Analysis Agent
- Compares multiple documents and highlights:
  - Key similarities and differences.  
  - Conflicting statements or contradictions.  
  - Recommended actions or clarifications.  
- Example use case: *"Compare HR Policy 2023 vs. 2024 and highlight conflicts."*  
- Output: structured report with summaries, conflict list, and recommendations.

### 2. Proactive Agent
- Runs automatically when new documents are uploaded.  
- Tasks:
  - Classifies document type (policy, meeting notes, IT guidelines).  
  - Generates summaries and extracts action points.  
  - Performs risk scoring (e.g., GDPR compliance, sensitive data indicators).  
  - Sends **Slack/Teams notifications** with key insights and links.  
- Example use case: *Upload a new IT Security Policy → Slack notification with summary + risk flag.*

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leiyese/agile-methods-rainbow6.git
cd agile-methods-rainbow6
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

#### Getting a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key or use an existing one
3. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env` file

### 3. Start the Application
